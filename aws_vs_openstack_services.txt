============================================
OpenStack services (categorized) — verified against OpenStack 2025.2 “Flamingo” (released Oct 1, 2025)

IaaS (core infrastructure):
- Identity & access: Keystone
- Images: Glance
- Resource placement / inventory: Placement
- Compute (VMs): Nova
- Bare metal: Ironic

- Infrastructure optimization: Watcher
- RCA / event correlation: Vitrage
- Instance high availability: Masakari
- Compute inside Object Storage (run code near Swift): Storlets
- Day-2 operations / self-service workflows: Adjutant

FaaS (Serverless):
- No core OpenStack “functions-as-a-service” in the 2025.2 service set; typically delivered via Kubernetes serverless layers deployed on top of OpenStack (e.g., Knative/OpenFaaS).

CaaS (Containers):
- Kubernetes / container infrastructure management: Magnum
- Containers-as-a-service (run containers as first-class resources): Zun

SaaS (end-user / UI):
- Classic dashboard: Horizon
- Modern dashboard: Skyline (Skyline-apiserver + Skyline-console)

Practical caveat:
- Even if a project is in the 2025.2 service set, packaging can vary by distribution/deployer; for example, Kolla notes it dropped building Venus container images due to the project’s inactivity and related Horizon plugin build issues.
